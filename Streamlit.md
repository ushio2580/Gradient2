# Gradient and Line Search Visualization

This repository contains a Streamlit application that allows users to explore optimization concepts such as gradients, Hessians, and line search methods for functions of two variables. The application is split into two interactive sections:

1. **Gradient and Hessian Calculation**: Compute and visualize the gradient and Hessian of a user-defined function of two variables.
2. **Line Search Demonstration**: Perform a line search on a predefined function, showing the search path and verifying the minimum condition.

---

## Features

- **Gradient and Hessian Tab**:
  - Input a custom function of two variables (e.g., `1/2*(x2 - x1**2)**2 + (1 - x1)**2`).
  - Compute partial derivatives, gradient vector, and Hessian matrix.
  - Visualize the function with a 3D surface plot and contour plot.
- **Line Search Tab**:
  - Uses a predefined function: \( f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_1 x_2 + 4x_1 - x_2 + 1 \).
  - Starts at \(\vec{x}_0 = [2, -1]^T\) with direction \(\vec{p} = [-1, 1]^T\).
  - Demonstrates the line search process, including the optimal step size and verification of the minimum.
  - Includes visualizations: 3D surface plot with path, contour plot with path, and function value along the path.
- **Mathematical Display**: Equations are rendered in LaTeX for clarity.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need the following Python libraries:

- `streamlit` - For the interactive web interface.
- `sympy` - For symbolic mathematics (e.g., derivatives, Hessian).
- `numpy` - For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` - For creating 3D and contour plots.

Install these dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit sympy numpy matplotlib
```

**Python Version**: Requires Python 3.7 or higher.

---

## How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ushio2580/Gradient2.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Gradient2
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit sympy numpy matplotlib
   ```

4. **Launch the Application**:
   Run the Streamlit app with:
   ```bash
   streamlit run test2.py
   ```
   This will start a local server and open the application in your default web browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage

Once the application is running, youâ€™ll see two tabs:

### ðŸ§® Example 1: Gradient and Hessian
- **Input**: Enter a function of two variables using `x1` and `x2` (e.g., `1/2*(x2 - x1**2)**2 + (1 - x1)**2`).
- **Outputs**:
  - Partial derivatives: \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}\).
  - Gradient vector: \(\nabla f(x_1, x_2)\).
  - Second-order derivatives and Hessian matrix: \(\nabla^2 f(x_1, x_2)\).
  - Visualizations:
    - **3D Surface Plot**: Shows the functionâ€™s surface.
    - **Contour Plot**: Displays level curves of the function.

### ðŸ“ˆ Example 2: Line Search
- **Setup**: Uses the function \( f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_1 x_2 + 4x_1 - x_2 + 1 \), starting at \(\vec{x}_0 = [2, -1]^T\), with direction \(\vec{p} = [-1, 1]^T\).
- **Process**:
  - Defines the parametric path: \(\vec{x}(t) = \vec{x}_0 + t \vec{p}\).
  - Computes the optimal step size \(t^*\) where the directional derivative is zero.
  - Verifies the minimum condition: \(\nabla f(\vec{z})^T \vec{p} = 0\).
- **Visualizations**:
  - **3D Surface with Path**: Plots the function surface with the search path.
  - **Contour Plot with Path**: Shows the path on the functionâ€™s contours.
  - **Function Value Along Path**: Graphs \(f(t)\) with the optimal point marked.

## File Structure

- `test2.py`: The main Streamlit application file containing all the code.

*(Note: You can optionally add a `requirements.txt` file by listing the dependencies as shown below.)*

---

## Example

- **Gradient and Hessian**: Try entering `1/2*(x2 - x1**2)**2 + (1 - x1)**2` in the first tab to see its gradient, Hessian, and plots.
- **Line Search**: The second tab automatically demonstrates the line search process with the predefined function and conditions.

---

## Optional: Create a `requirements.txt`

If youâ€™d like to include a `requirements.txt` file for easier dependency management, create it with:

```plaintext
streamlit
sympy
numpy
matplotlib
```

Then install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Error Processing Function**: Ensure your function input is valid (e.g., uses `x1` and `x2`, avoids undefined operations).
- **Plots Not Displaying**: Verify that `matplotlib` is installed correctly.
- **Streamlit Not Running**: Check that youâ€™re in the correct directory and that `test2.py` exists.
