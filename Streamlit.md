# Gradient and Line Search Visualization

This Streamlit application is an interactive tool for exploring gradients, Hessians, and line search methods for functions of two variables. Itâ€™s built to help users understand these fundamental optimization concepts through hands-on calculations and visualizations.

## Features

- **Gradient and Hessian Calculation**: Input a function of two variables to compute its gradient and Hessian matrix.
- **Function Visualization**: Generate 3D surface plots and contour plots of your input function.
- **Line Search Demonstration**: Explore the line search optimization method with a predefined function, complete with visualizations of the search path and function values.
